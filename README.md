# material-requisition-demo
Material requisition demo for presentation. Spring boot + Swagger + Java 8 + Postgres.


This is a very simple application to manage internal material. It provides
  - a list of who is using which material.
  - a list of available material. 
  - a material requisition form.
  - a material devolution form.
  
  The user can request: a book, a laptop, a monitor, a video projector, etc.
  
  The application exposes a full described RESTFUL API.
  
  And the main goal is how this application can be distributed with docker.
